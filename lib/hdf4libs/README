This directory contains the binary distribution of HDF 4.2r4
for Linux 2.6 x86_64.  These binaries were built with the following
C and Fortran compilers:

    gcc 4.1.2 and g95 4.0.3 (g95 0.92!) 

For more information on the options that were used to compile
these binaries, see the following file:

    lib/libhdf4.settings

Contents of this directory:

    COPYING     - Copyright notice
    README      - This file
    RELEASE.txt - Release notes
    bin/        - HDF utilities
    include/    - Include files
    lib/        - HDF libraries
    share/      - Man pages (for ncdump, ncgen...)

The binaries were built with the following libraries included,
but they do not include these libraries: 

    ZLIB library (version 1.1.4 or later) 
    JPEG library (version 6b)
    SZIP library (version 2.0, 2.1) with the Encoder enabled

As a convenience, we provide some of the pre-compiled external 
libraries from our web site at:

    ZLIB:  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/lib-external/zlib/ 
    JPEG:  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/lib-external/jpeg/
    SZIP:  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/lib-external/szip/

NOTE: The software can be accessed by specifying either
"http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/" or "ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/".
   
For information regarding each of these libraries, see:

    ZLIB:  http://www.gzip.org/
    JPEG:  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/
    SZIP:  http://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/

Scripts for compiling applications are included with the binaries:

    bin/h4cc  - for C
    bin/h4fc  - for Fortran  (if the library is built 
                              with Fortran enabled)

After you have installed the binaries to their final directory, then:

    cd to the bin/ directory 
    run ./h4redeploy and enter yes to the question  

Each compile script has site specific paths in it, and in many cases,
./h4redeploy will change the paths to run on your system.  However, 
you should still check the compile script, and if need be, modify the 
variables (or set them as environment variables) to work on your system.  
Here are some of the variables to check:

  prefix      - Path to the HDF top level installation directory
  CCBASE      - Name of the alternative C compiler
  CLINKERBASE - Name of the alternative linker
  LDFLAGS     - Path to different libraries your application will link 
                with (this path should include the path to the ZLIB 
                library)
  LIBS        - Libraries your application will link with

You can use the -show option with the compile scripts to see if the paths
being used are correct. For example:

   h4cc -show

If these binaries do not work for you, you can compile and install
HDF 4.2r4 yourself.  The HDF source code can be found in:

    http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF/HDF_Current/src/

NOTE: The software can be accessed by specifying either
"http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/" or "ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/".

To build from source, refer to the INSTALL file in the top 
directory of the HDF source code.
